        <h3>Market Tracker & AI Analyst Dashboard</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
          A stock dashboard built with Python (Dash + Plotly + yfinance) that displays candlestick charts
          and includes an AI assistant powered by Gemini to answer market-related questions.

        <div id="market-details" class="hidden details-box">
          <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python, Dash, Plotly, yfinance, Gemini API</p>
          <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Data visualization, API integration, UI/UX design, caching, prompt engineering</p>
          <p><strong>How to Run:</strong></p>
          <pre>
            1. Download the Code: They need to pull your code onto their local machine first.
                git clone https://github.com/connie4-beep/stock_dashboard.git
                cd stock_dashboard
            2. Create a Virtual Environment: They shouldn't install your packages directly into their system's main Python setup. They need to create an isolated environment so your dependencies don't conflict with their other projects.
                python -m venv venv

            3. Activate the Environment: They must "turn on" the environment.
                Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
                Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

            4. Install the Requirements: Now they can safely run your installation command inside their isolated environment.
                pip install -r requirements.txt

            5. Set up the Environment Variables: Because you smartly excluded your .env file using .gitignore, it won't be in the repository they download. You need to instruct them to create their own .env file in the main folder and add their own GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here".

            6. Run the App: Finally, they can launch the dashboard.
                python app.py

        <h3>Project: Implemented a hybrid image pipeline</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
          Implemented a hybrid image pipeline for CS445: Computational Photography to explore image frequency representations and enhancement techniques. 
          Created hybrid images by combining the high-frequency component of one image with the low-frequency component of another, 
          producing images that change perception based on viewing distance. Applied frequency analysis using Fourier transforms to visualize input, 
          filtered, and hybrid images. Extended the project with image enhancement tasks including contrast adjustment, color enhancement, and color shifts, 
          using Python and OpenCV to manipulate images in HSV and LAB color spaces, improving both visual clarity and aesthetic quality.
        </p>

        <ul class="project-list">
          <li>Implemented hybrid image creation using Python by blending high- and low-frequency components, 
            producing images that change perception with viewing distance</li>
          <li>Applied Fourier transforms and frequency filtering (Gaussian and Laplacian) to analyze and visualize image components</li>
          <li>Enhanced images through contrast, color, and hue adjustments using OpenCV, 
            demonstrating control over color spaces and image enhancement techniques</li>

        <h3>Research: Demographic Determinants of Political Donations</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
          This project analyzed the impact of advertising and social media exposure on donor behavior, 
          focusing on understanding how outreach strategies influence contribution patterns. 
          I cleaned and merged large ZIP-level datasets from multiple sources, enabling a comprehensive county-level analysis. 
          Using statistical models, I quantified the relationships between demographic factors, social media engagement, 
          and donation activity, uncovering insights into how different outreach methods drive donor participation.
